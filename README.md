# Projects
To store all my projects that I'll be working on during my university(B.Sc.) period.

[Utility Software](https://github.com/helix-77/Projects/tree/main/Utility%20Software) (CSE-2100 project): Use Python and Tkinter to build a fully functional GUI program that has many tools embedded in it. (Anything of my choice)

[Integrated Population Prediction](https://github.com/helix-77/Projects/tree/main/Numerical%20Integrated%20Population%20Prediction) (CSE- 2203 assignment): You are tasked with predicting the population growth of a city using historical data. Your goal is to create an integrated model that combines Newton's Interpolation, Newton's Raphson Method, and curve fitting. You are provided with a CSV containing Year and Populations.
